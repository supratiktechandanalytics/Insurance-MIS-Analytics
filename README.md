# INSURANCE_ANALYSIS
<p>This dashboard centres on the seamless integration of data cleaning, transformation, and profiling using PowerBI Desktop. It begins by importing data from Excel, followed by a comprehensive data profiling phase where additional columns like "Index" and "Age group" are introduced for enhanced reporting. Each record corresponds to an individual, and subsequent checks ensure data quality by assessing column distribution, profiles, and the absence of errors or null values. The dashboard leverages PowerBI Desktop's report view, employing various visual formatting techniques to create an informative and visually appealing representation of the enriched dataset. This approach ensures a solid foundation for insightful reporting and decision-making.

As per the reporting requirement, it is required to identify each individual by a unique ID. That’s why the name index column is replaced with an ID column.
Minimum age is 18 or maximum is 64. Age group column: using the conditioning column (if age is less than 25, then consider A1).(If age is less than 51, then consider A2); otherwise,  A3)
According to this column, we tried to categorise people or put people in different categories according to their age group.

  <b>2. AVERAGE CHARGES BY AGE GROUP:</b> 

  Stacked bar charts represent average charges for all different age groups; there are three different age groups. A1, A2, and A3. Charts show high to low charges according to age group (A3, A2, and A1). A3 considers an age group of 51 to 64, A2 considers an age group of 25 to 50, and A1 considers an age group of less than 25.

  <b>3. NUMBER OF SMOKERS :</b> 
  
</p>This donut chart represents the proposition of people who are smokers or non-smokers. It represents that the number of people who are smokers is equal to 0.27k, and the percentage is 20.48%. The non-smoker count is 1.06k in numbers and, in percentage, 79.52%. The higher proportion of non-smokers suggests a potentially lower risk profile for the overall insured population, as non-smokers generally exhibit lower health risks and may require fewer claims.<p>
  
  <b>4. NUMBER OF CUSTOMER BY COUNT OF CHILDREN :</b> 
  
  The chart breaks down the number of customers based on their count of children. It's noticeable that a large majority, 574 customers to be exact, have no children, suggesting a prevalent trend towards smaller families. As the number of children increases, the count decreases, with only 18 customers reporting having 5 children. This insight is valuable for tailoring insurance products and marketing efforts to align with the demographics of the majority, ensuring that offerings meet the needs of customers with various family sizes.</p>

  <b>5. AVERAGE BY BMI BY SEX OR SMOKER (Y OR N) :
  </b> 
 
 In this manner, represent the average body mass index (BMI) and find that, on average, men have slightly higher BMIs than women. When we further look into smoking habits, it appears that both male and female smokers tend to have a slightly lower average BMI compared to non-smokers. This simple breakdown helps us understand how BMI differs between genders and based on smoking habits, offering insights that can be useful for personalised health and insurance considerations.</p>
